## Overview

Cryptique is a **unified analytics platform for Web3** that solves the fundamental attribution problem in blockchain applications: connecting anonymous wallet transactions with the user journeys that led to them.

Traditional analytics tools track website behavior but stop at the wallet connection. Blockchain explorers show transaction data but have no context about user intent. Cryptique bridges this gap by creating **complete user profiles** that unify:

- **Off-chain behavior**: Page views, clicks, form submissions, feature usage
- **Wallet connections**: Which wallets users connect and when
- **On-chain transactions**: Swaps, mints, staking, purchases, and any smart contract interaction

## The Attribution Problem in Web3

In Web2, attribution is straightforward: you track a user from ad click to signup to purchase using cookies and user IDs. In Web3, this breaks down because:

1. **Wallet addresses are pseudonymous** — You can see that `0x1234...` bought your NFT, but not which marketing campaign brought them
2. **Users have multiple wallets** — The same person might connect different wallets across sessions
3. **On-chain and off-chain data live in silos** — Your web analytics and blockchain data never meet

Cryptique solves this with a **CQ Intelligence** merge engine that automatically connects:

```
Website Visit → Wallet Connection → On-chain Transaction
     ↓               ↓                    ↓
  distinct_id ←→ wallet_address ←→ transaction_hash
```

## How It Works

### 1. Install the SDK

Add a single script to your website or dApp:

```html
<script>
  var script = document.createElement('script');
  script.src = 'https://cdn.cryptique.io/scripts/analytics/1.0.1/cryptique.script.min.js';  
  script.setAttribute('site-id', 'your-site-id');
  document.head.appendChild(script);
</script>
```

### 2. Automatic Event Capture

Cryptique automatically tracks page views, sessions, clicks, scroll depth, and wallet connections—no additional code required.

### 3. Link Wallets to Users

When a user connects their wallet, Cryptique automatically links that wallet address to their existing profile:

```javascript
// Automatic wallet detection works out of the box
// Or explicitly track wallet connections:
cryptique.wallet.connect('0x1234...abcd');
```

### 4. Index Your Smart Contracts

Add your smart contracts in the dashboard to automatically capture all transactions:

- Token transfers and swaps
- NFT mints and sales  
- Staking and liquidity provision
- Any custom contract interaction

### 5. Analyze Complete Journeys

Use Insights, Funnels, Retention, and Flows reports to understand the complete path from first visit to on-chain conversion.

## Use Cases

### For DeFi Protocols
- Track which features lead to first swap
- Measure retention by transaction frequency
- Identify power users vs. one-time traders
- Attribute liquidity provision to marketing campaigns

### For NFT Projects
- Understand the mint funnel: landing page → connect wallet → mint
- Segment collectors by on-chain history (whale vs. retail)
- Track secondary market activity back to original acquisition source

### For Web3 Games
- Measure player progression from signup to first in-game purchase
- Correlate gameplay behavior with token transactions
- Identify churn predictors using combined off-chain and on-chain signals

### For L2s and Infrastructure
- Track developer onboarding funnels
- Measure contract deployment conversions
- Attribute mainnet transactions to documentation visits

## Overview

Filters let you narrow down data to specific segments. Cryptique provides a visual query builder with AND/OR logic and type-specific operators for precise filtering.

## Filter Types

You can filter by five categories:

| Filter Type | Description | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| **Event Filters** | Filter by event name and properties | Events where `event_name = "swap_completed"` |
| **User Profile Filters** | Filter by user properties | Users where `plan = "pro"` |
| **Transaction Filters** | Filter on-chain transactions | Transactions where `chain = "ethereum"` |
| **Time Filters** | Filter by date/time ranges | Events in `last 30 days` |
| **Cohort Filters** | Filter by cohort membership | Users in `"Power Users"` cohort |

## Query Builder

Cryptique uses a visual query builder with AND/OR logic:

```
Filter where:
├── event_name = "swap_completed"
├── AND chain = "ethereum"
└── OR (
    ├── amount_usd > 1000
    └── AND user_tier = "whale"
)
```

Combine conditions with:
- **AND**: All conditions must be true
- **OR**: At least one condition must be true
- **Grouping**: Nest conditions for complex logic

## String Operators

For text properties like `country`, `browser_name`, `event_name`:

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `is` | Exact match | `country is "US"` |
| `is_not` | Does not equal | `country is_not "US"` |
| `contains` | Contains substring | `email contains "@gmail"` |
| `does_not_contain` | Does not contain substring | `email does_not_contain "test"` |
| `is_set` | Property has any value | `email is_set` |
| `is_not_set` | Property has no value | `email is_not_set` |

### String Examples

```
# Exact match
country is "United States"

# Exclude specific value
browser_name is_not "Safari"

# Partial match
current_url contains "/swap"
page_title contains "Dashboard"

# Check existence
wallet_address is_set      # Only Web3 users
email is_not_set           # Anonymous users
```

## Number Operators

For numeric properties like `amount_usd`, `transaction_count`, `session_duration`:

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `equal` | Equals | `amount equal 100` |
| `not_equal` | Does not equal | `amount not_equal 0` |
| `greater_than` | Greater than | `amount greater_than 100` |
| `greater_than_equal` | Greater than or equal | `amount greater_than_equal 100` |
| `less_than` | Less than | `amount less_than 1000` |
| `less_than_equal` | Less than or equal | `amount less_than_equal 1000` |
| `between` | In range (inclusive) | `amount between 100 and 1000` |
| `not_between` | Outside range | `amount not_between 100 and 1000` |
| `is_numeric` | Has a numeric value | `price is_numeric` |
| `is_not_numeric` | Not a number (null/NaN) | `price is_not_numeric` |

### Number Examples

```
# Exact value
transaction_count equal 0          # Users with no transactions

# Comparisons
amount_usd greater_than 1000       # High-value transactions
gas_used less_than 100000          # Low gas transactions

# Range filtering
amount_usd between 100 and 10000   # Mid-tier transactions
session_duration not_between 0 and 10  # Exclude bounces

# Existence checks
token_balance is_numeric           # Has balance data
```

## Boolean Operators

For true/false properties like `is_web3_user`, `has_completed_onboarding`:

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `is_true` | Property is true | `is_web3_user is_true` |
| `is_false` | Property is false | `is_web3_user is_false` |

### Boolean Examples

```
# Web3 users only
is_web3_user is_true

# Traditional Web2 users
is_web3_user is_false

# Custom boolean properties
has_completed_onboarding is_true
is_verified is_false
```

## Datetime Operators

For date/time properties like `timestamp`, `created_at`, `last_seen`:

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `last` | Within the last N days/hours | `timestamp last 7 days` |
| `not_in_the_last` | Not within the last N days | `timestamp not_in_the_last 7 days` |
| `between` | Between two dates | `timestamp between Jan 1 and Jan 31` |
| `not_between` | Outside date range | `timestamp not_between Jan 1 and Jan 31` |
| `on` | On specific date | `timestamp on Jan 15` |
| `not_on` | Not on specific date | `timestamp not_on Jan 1` |
| `before_the_last` | Before the last N days | `timestamp before_the_last 30 days` |
| `before` | Before specific date | `timestamp before Jan 1, 2024` |
| `since` | Since specific date | `timestamp since Jan 1, 2024` |
| `in_the_next` | Within the next N days | `expiry_date in_the_next 7 days` |

### Datetime Examples

```
# Relative time filters
timestamp last 30 days             # Last month's activity
timestamp last 24 hours            # Today's events
created_at not_in_the_last 90 days # Older users only

# Date range
timestamp between "2024-01-01" and "2024-01-31"
timestamp not_between "2024-12-24" and "2024-12-26"  # Exclude holidays

# Specific date
timestamp on "2024-01-15"          # Single day
timestamp not_on "2024-01-01"      # Exclude New Year

# Before/after
timestamp before "2024-06-01"      # Before June
timestamp since "2024-01-01"       # This year only
first_seen before_the_last 365 days  # Users over a year old

# Future dates (for expiry, subscription end, etc.)
subscription_end in_the_next 30 days  # Expiring soon
```

## List Operators

For array properties like `chains_used`, `tokens_held`, `tags`:

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `any_in_list` | Any item matches | `chains_used any_in_list ["ethereum", "polygon"]` |
| `all_in_list` | All items match | `required_tags all_in_list ["verified", "active"]` |

List operators can be combined with **nested operators** based on item type:

### List with String Items

```
# Any chain is ethereum OR polygon
chains_used any_in_list where item is "ethereum" OR item is "polygon"

# User has used any EVM chain
chains_used any_in_list where item contains "evm"

# All tags must be from approved list
tags all_in_list where item is "verified" OR item is "premium"
```

### List with Number Items

```
# Any transaction over $1000
transaction_amounts any_in_list where item greater_than 1000

# All balances are positive
token_balances all_in_list where item greater_than 0
```

## Filter Combinations

### AND Logic

All conditions must be true:

```
Events where:
├── event_name is "swap_completed"
├── AND chain is "ethereum"
├── AND amount_usd greater_than 100
└── AND timestamp last 7 days

→ Only Ethereum swaps over $100 in the last week
```

### OR Logic

At least one condition must be true:

```
Users where:
├── plan is "pro"
└── OR total_transactions greater_than 100

→ Pro users OR users with 100+ transactions
```

### Nested Groups

Combine AND/OR with grouping:

```
Events where:
├── event_name is "swap_completed"
└── AND (
    ├── chain is "ethereum"
    └── OR chain is "arbitrum"
)
└── AND (
    ├── amount_usd greater_than 1000
    └── OR user_tier is "whale"
)

→ Swaps on Ethereum or Arbitrum that are either 
   high-value ($1000+) or from whale users
```

## Event Filters

Filter events by name and properties:

```
Events:
├── event_name is "swap_completed"
├── Properties:
│   ├── input_token is "ETH"
│   ├── AND output_token is "USDC"
│   └── AND slippage less_than 1
```

### Common Event Filters

| Filter | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| `event_name is "wallet_connect"` | Only wallet connections |
| `event_category is "transaction"` | Only transaction events |
| `custom_properties.campaign is "summer"` | Campaign-specific events |

## User Profile Filters

Filter by user attributes:

```
Users:
├── plan is "pro"
├── AND country is "US"
├── AND is_web3_user is_true
└── AND wallet_address is_set
```

### Common User Filters

| Filter | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| `is_web3_user is_true` | Web3 users only |
| `first_seen last 30 days` | New users |
| `session_count greater_than 10` | Engaged users |
| `wallet_address is_set` | Users with connected wallets |

## Transaction Filters

Filter on-chain transactions:

```
Transactions:
├── chain is "ethereum"
├── AND contract_name is "Swap Router"
├── AND method_name is "swapExactTokensForTokens"
└── AND value greater_than 0
```

### Common Transaction Filters

| Filter | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| `chain is "ethereum"` | Ethereum transactions |
| `status is "confirmed"` | Successful transactions |
| `gas_price less_than 50` | Low gas transactions |
| `method_name contains "swap"` | Swap transactions |

## Cohort Filters

Filter by cohort membership:

```
Users:
├── IN cohort "Power Users"
└── AND NOT IN cohort "Churned Users"
```

Cohort filters are particularly useful for:
- Comparing behavior across segments
- Excluding specific user groups
- Analyzing high-value users

## Time Filters

Every report supports time range selection:

```
Time Range: Last 30 days
Granularity: Daily

OR

Custom Range: Jan 1, 2024 - Jan 31, 2024
Granularity: Weekly
```

See [Time Controls](/analysis/time-controls) for detailed time range options.

## Saved Filters

Save frequently used filters for reuse:

1. Build your filter combination
2. Click **Save Filter**
3. Name it descriptively: "US Pro Web3 Users"
4. Apply to any report with one click

## Best Practices

### Be Specific

```
✅ Good: event_name is "swap_completed" AND chain is "ethereum"
❌ Vague: event_name contains "swap"
```

### Use Appropriate Operators

```
✅ For exact match: is / equal
✅ For ranges: between / greater_than
✅ For text search: contains

❌ Using contains for exact values
❌ Using is for partial matches
```

### Test Filter Results

Before building complex reports, verify your filters:

1. Apply filter to simple metric (total events)
2. Check count makes sense
3. Spot-check sample records if possible

### Document Complex Filters

For complex nested logic, add comments:

```
# High-value users: Pro plan OR whale behavior
Users where:
├── plan is "pro"                    # Paying customers
└── OR (
    ├── total_volume greater_than 100000  # High volume
    └── AND transaction_count greater_than 50  # Active
)
```

## Overview

Time controls let you define what time period to analyze and at what granularity to view the data. Every report in Cryptique supports flexible time configuration.

## Time Range Selection

### Preset Ranges

Quick selection for common time periods:

| Preset | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Today** | Current day (midnight to now) |
| **Yesterday** | Previous full day |
| **Last 7 days** | Past week including today |
| **Last 14 days** | Past two weeks |
| **Last 30 days** | Past month |
| **Last 90 days** | Past quarter |
| **Last 365 days** | Past year |
| **This week** | Current week (Monday to now) |
| **This month** | Current month (1st to now) |
| **This quarter** | Current quarter |
| **This year** | Current year (Jan 1 to now) |

### Custom Date Range

Select specific start and end dates:

```
Custom Range:
├── Start: January 1, 2024
└── End: January 31, 2024

Include: All events from Jan 1 00:00 to Jan 31 23:59
```

### Rolling Windows

Automatically update to show the most recent data:

```
Rolling 30 days:
├── Always shows the last 30 days
├── Updates automatically each day
└── Great for dashboards
```

## Granularity

Granularity controls how data is grouped in time-series views:

| Granularity | Best For |
|-------------|----------|
| **Hourly** | Intraday patterns, short-term analysis |
| **Daily** | Day-over-day trends, standard analysis |
| **Weekly** | Week-over-week patterns, smoothing noise |
| **Monthly** | Long-term trends, executive reporting |
| **Quarterly** | Business planning, strategic analysis |

### Matching Granularity to Range

```
✅ Good combinations:
├── Last 24 hours → Hourly granularity
├── Last 7 days → Daily granularity
├── Last 30 days → Daily or weekly
├── Last 90 days → Weekly granularity
├── Last 365 days → Monthly granularity

❌ Poor combinations:
├── Last 365 days → Hourly (too many data points)
├── Last 24 hours → Monthly (not enough data)
```

## Time Comparisons

Compare current period to previous periods:

### Previous Period

Compare to the immediately preceding period:

```
Last 7 days vs Previous 7 days:
├── Current: 1,234 swaps
├── Previous: 1,100 swaps
└── Change: +12.2%
```

### Same Period Last Year

Compare to the same period one year ago:

```
January 2024 vs January 2023:
├── Current: 45,000 users
├── Last year: 28,000 users
└── Change: +60.7% YoY
```

### Custom Comparison

Compare any two time periods:

```
Compare:
├── Period A: Dec 1-31, 2023 (holiday season)
├── Period B: Nov 1-30, 2023 (pre-holiday)
└── See: Holiday impact on metrics
```

## Session Timing

Cryptique uses a **30-minute session timeout** (not configurable):

```
Session Definition:
├── Session starts: First event from user
├── Session continues: Events within 30 min of last event
├── Session ends: 30 min of inactivity
└── New session: Activity after 30 min gap
```

### Session Examples

```
User Activity Timeline:
├── 10:00 - page_view (Session 1 starts)
├── 10:05 - button_click (Session 1 continues)
├── 10:15 - swap_completed (Session 1 continues)
├── 10:45 - (30 min idle)
├── 11:00 - page_view (Session 2 starts)
└── 11:30 - session ends

Result: 2 sessions
```

## Time-Based Filtering

Filter events by time properties:

### Event Timestamp

```
Filter: timestamp last 30 days
Filter: timestamp between "2024-01-01" and "2024-01-31"
Filter: timestamp since "2024-01-01"
```

### User First Seen

```
Filter: first_seen last 7 days
→ Only new users from this week
```

### User Last Seen

```
Filter: last_seen before_the_last 30 days
→ Users who haven't been active in a month
```

See [Filters & Operators](/analysis/filters-and-operators) for complete datetime operators.

## Timezone Handling

Cryptique automatically captures user timezone:

```
Default Property: timezone
Example values: "America/New_York", "Europe/London", "Asia/Tokyo"
```

### Dashboard Timezone

Reports display in your selected timezone:

1. Go to **Settings**
2. Select your timezone
3. All reports adjust accordingly

### UTC Storage

All timestamps are stored in UTC internally:
- Consistent data across timezones
- No daylight saving issues
- Accurate global comparisons

## Time Patterns

### Day of Week Analysis

Breakdown by day to see weekly patterns:

```
Swaps by day of week:
├── Monday: 15%
├── Tuesday: 16%
├── Wednesday: 17%
├── Thursday: 16%
├── Friday: 18%
├── Saturday: 10%
└── Sunday: 8%

Insight: Weekday trading dominates
```

### Hour of Day Analysis

Breakdown by hour for daily patterns:

```
Swaps by hour (UTC):
├── 00-04: Low activity
├── 04-08: Rising (Asia)
├── 08-12: Peak (Europe)
├── 12-16: High (US East opens)
├── 16-20: Peak (US full)
└── 20-00: Declining

Insight: Schedule campaigns for peak hours
```

### Monthly Trends

See seasonality:

```
Monthly active users:
├── Jan: 45K
├── Feb: 48K
├── Mar: 52K
├── Apr: 58K
├── May: 55K
├── Jun: 50K
├── Jul: 48K
├── Aug: 51K
├── Sep: 60K
├── Oct: 65K
├── Nov: 70K
└── Dec: 62K

Insight: Q4 is your peak season
```

## Web3 Time Considerations

### Block Time vs Event Time

Cryptique tracks both:
- **Event time**: When user initiated action
- **Transaction time**: When block was mined

```
User clicks "Swap" at 10:00:00 (event_time)
Transaction confirms at 10:00:45 (block_time)

Events use event_time
Transactions use block_time
```

### Chain-Specific Timing

Different blockchains have different block times:

| Chain | Avg Block Time |
|-------|---------------|
| Ethereum | ~12 seconds |
| Polygon | ~2 seconds |
| Arbitrum | ~0.25 seconds |
| Base | ~2 seconds |

For time-sensitive analysis, consider block confirmations.

## Dashboard Time Controls

### Global Time Selector

Dashboards can have a global time selector:

```
Dashboard: Weekly Overview
Global Time: Last 7 days

All charts on dashboard use "Last 7 days"
Override individual charts if needed
```

### Per-Chart Time

Override global time for specific charts:

```
Dashboard Time: Last 7 days

Chart 1: Uses dashboard time (7 days)
Chart 2: Uses dashboard time (7 days)
Chart 3: Custom time (Last 30 days) ← Override
```

## Best Practices

### Match Time to Question

```
Question: What happened today?
Time: Today, hourly granularity

Question: How are we trending this month?
Time: Last 30 days, daily granularity

Question: Year-over-year growth?
Time: Last 365 days, monthly granularity
```

### Use Comparisons Wisely

```
✅ Good comparisons:
├── Week-over-week (similar periods)
├── Month-over-month (business rhythm)
├── Year-over-year (seasonal adjustment)

❌ Poor comparisons:
├── Monday vs Sunday (different behavior)
├── Holiday vs normal week (outliers)
├── Launch week vs normal (unusual activity)
```

### Account for Data Lag

Recent data may be incomplete:

```
If analyzing "Today":
├── Events appear in real-time
├── Transactions may have confirmation lag
├── Some aggregations update hourly

Recommendation: Use "Yesterday" for complete daily data
```

### Smooth Volatility

Use longer time ranges or weekly granularity to smooth noise:

```
Daily view: Volatile, hard to see trend
Weekly view: Smoother, clear trend visible
```

## Overview

Breakdowns segment your metrics by property values, showing how different groups compare. Instead of seeing total swaps, see swaps broken down by chain, country, device, or any other property.

## How Breakdowns Work

Without breakdown:
```
Total Swaps: 10,000
```

With breakdown by `chain`:
```
Total Swaps by Chain:
├── ethereum: 4,500 (45%)
├── polygon: 2,800 (28%)
├── arbitrum: 1,700 (17%)
└── base: 1,000 (10%)
```

## Breakdown Types

### Event Property Breakdowns

Segment by properties attached to events:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `chain` | Blockchain network |
| `input_token` | Token being swapped from |
| `output_token` | Token being swapped to |
| `wallet_type` | MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc. |
| `event_category` | Event classification |
| Custom properties | Any property you track |

```
Event: swap_completed
Breakdown by: input_token

Result:
├── ETH: 3,200 swaps
├── USDC: 2,800 swaps
├── USDT: 1,500 swaps
└── DAI: 800 swaps
```

### User Property Breakdowns

Segment by user attributes:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `country` | User's country |
| `city` | User's city |
| `device_type` | Desktop, mobile, tablet |
| `browser_name` | Chrome, Safari, Firefox |
| `os` | Operating system |
| `plan` | Subscription tier |
| `is_web3_user` | Web3 vs Web2 user |
| Custom properties | Any user property |

```
Metric: Unique Active Users
Breakdown by: device_type

Result:
├── desktop: 8,500 users
├── mobile: 3,200 users
└── tablet: 300 users
```

### Transaction Property Breakdowns

Segment by on-chain data:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `chain` | Blockchain network |
| `contract_name` | Smart contract name |
| `method_name` | Function called |
| `status` | Transaction status |
| Custom properties | Indexed event parameters |

```
Metric: Total Transactions
Breakdown by: method_name

Result:
├── swapExactTokensForTokens: 5,600
├── addLiquidity: 2,100
├── removeLiquidity: 1,200
└── other: 800
```

### Time Breakdowns

Segment by time periods:

| Granularity | Use Case |
|-------------|----------|
| Hour | Intraday patterns |
| Day | Daily trends |
| Week | Weekly patterns |
| Month | Monthly trends |
| Quarter | Quarterly analysis |

```
Metric: Swap Count
Breakdown by: Day

Result:
├── Mon: 1,500
├── Tue: 1,800
├── Wed: 2,100
├── Thu: 1,900
├── Fri: 2,300
├── Sat: 1,200
└── Sun: 1,000
```

## Multiple Breakdowns

Apply multiple breakdowns for deeper segmentation:

### Two-Level Breakdown

```
Metric: Swap Count
Breakdown 1: chain
Breakdown 2: device_type

Result:
├── ethereum
│   ├── desktop: 3,200
│   └── mobile: 1,300
├── polygon
│   ├── desktop: 1,900
│   └── mobile: 900
└── arbitrum
    ├── desktop: 1,200
    └── mobile: 500
```

### Three-Level Breakdown

```
Metric: Transaction Volume
Breakdown 1: chain
Breakdown 2: device_type
Breakdown 3: country

Result:
├── ethereum
│   ├── desktop
│   │   ├── US: $450K
│   │   ├── UK: $120K
│   │   └── DE: $80K
│   └── mobile
│       ├── US: $180K
│       └── ...
```

<Note>
Adding more breakdowns increases complexity. Start with one breakdown and add more only when needed.
</Note>

## Breakdown Display Options

### Top N Segments

Show only the most significant segments:

```
Show: Top 5 chains by swap count

Result:
├── ethereum: 4,500
├── polygon: 2,800
├── arbitrum: 1,700
├── base: 1,000
└── optimism: 800

(Other chains grouped or hidden)
```

### Other Grouping

Combine low-volume segments:

```
Show: Top 5 + Other

Result:
├── ethereum: 4,500
├── polygon: 2,800
├── arbitrum: 1,700
├── base: 1,000
├── optimism: 800
└── Other: 200 (combined)
```

### Sorting

Sort breakdowns by:
- **Value (descending)**: Highest first (default)
- **Value (ascending)**: Lowest first
- **Alphabetical**: A-Z
- **Custom order**: Define your own

## Breakdowns in Reports

### Insights

Breakdowns appear as:
- **Lines** on line charts (one line per segment)
- **Bars** on bar charts (grouped or stacked)
- **Slices** on pie charts
- **Rows** in tables

```
Line chart with chain breakdown:
─── ethereum (blue line)
─── polygon (purple line)
─── arbitrum (orange line)
```

### Funnels

Breakdowns show conversion by segment:

```
Funnel with device_type breakdown:

Desktop: 100% → 40% → 25% → 15%
Mobile:  100% → 25% → 12% → 6%
Tablet:  100% → 35% → 20% → 12%
```

### Retention

Breakdowns show retention curves by segment:

```
Retention with plan breakdown:

Pro:  Day 1: 55% → Day 7: 40% → Day 30: 32%
Free: Day 1: 35% → Day 7: 20% → Day 30: 12%
```

### Flows

Breakdowns split flows by segment:

```
Flow with device_type breakdown:

Desktop path: connect → swap → success (45%)
Mobile path:  connect → swap → success (25%)
```

## Cohort Breakdowns

Compare metrics across user cohorts:

```
Metric: Average Transaction Value
Breakdown by: Cohort

Result:
├── Whales: $5,200 avg
├── Active Traders: $450 avg
├── Casual Users: $85 avg
└── New Users: $42 avg
```

Creating cohorts allows you to segment by complex criteria. See [Cohorts](/analysis/cohorts) for details.

## Web3 Breakdown Examples

### Swap Volume by Chain

```
Event: swap_completed
Metric: Sum of amount_usd
Breakdown: chain

Insight: Which chains drive the most volume?
```

### Transaction Count by Token

```
Event: transaction
Metric: Total count
Breakdown: input_token
Filter: chain = "ethereum"

Insight: Most popular tokens on Ethereum
```

### User Distribution by Wallet Type

```
Event: wallet_connect
Metric: Unique users
Breakdown: wallet_type

Result:
├── metamask: 65%
├── walletconnect: 20%
├── coinbase_wallet: 10%
└── other: 5%
```

### Cross-Chain User Behavior

```
Metric: Unique users
Breakdown 1: chain
Breakdown 2: is_returning_user

Insight: Which chains have better retention?
```

## Best Practices

### Choose Meaningful Breakdowns

```
✅ Good breakdowns:
├── chain (actionable: optimize for popular chains)
├── device_type (actionable: fix mobile UX)
├── utm_source (actionable: optimize campaigns)
└── user_tier (actionable: pricing/features)

❌ Poor breakdowns:
├── user_id (too granular)
├── timestamp (use time breakdown instead)
└── random_id (meaningless)
```

### Limit Breakdown Cardinality

High-cardinality properties create noise:

```
❌ Avoid: Breakdown by wallet_address (millions of values)
✅ Better: Breakdown by wallet_type or country
```

### Use Appropriate Visualizations

| Breakdown Type | Best Visualization |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Few segments (<5) | Pie chart |
| Many segments (5-20) | Bar chart |
| Time-based | Line chart |
| Multiple levels | Table |

### Start Simple

Begin with one breakdown, validate insights, then add complexity:

```
1. Swaps by chain (single breakdown)
2. Swaps by chain and device (two breakdowns)
3. Swaps by chain, device, and country (if needed)
```

## Common Patterns

### Comparison Analysis

Compare performance across segments:

```
Question: Which chain has the highest conversion?

Funnel by chain:
├── Arbitrum: 18% conversion ⭐ Best
├── Polygon: 15% conversion
├── Ethereum: 12% conversion
└── Base: 10% conversion

Action: Investigate Arbitrum UX, replicate elsewhere
```

### Segment Discovery

Find your best-performing segments:

```
Question: Who are our power users?

Active users by:
├── country: US leads with 45%
├── device: Desktop users 3x more active
├── plan: Pro users 5x more transactions

Action: Focus on US desktop Pro users
```

### Trend Analysis

See how segments change over time:

```
Question: Is mobile adoption growing?

Device breakdown over 6 months:
├── Desktop: 80% → 75% → 70%
├── Mobile: 20% → 25% → 30%

Trend: Mobile growing, invest in mobile UX
```

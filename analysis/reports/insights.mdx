## Quick Start

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define Your Metric">
    Select what you want to measure. Click **Add Metric** and choose:
    - **Event**: Analyze event occurrences (e.g., `swap_completed`)

| **Event Property Sum** | Sum of a numeric property | "Total volume swapped (USD)" |
| **Event Property Average** | Average of a numeric property | "Average swap size" |
| **Sessions** | Count of distinct sessions | "Sessions with a swap" |

### Profile-Based Measurements

| Measurement | Description | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| **Profile Count** | Count of user profiles matching criteria | "Users with pro plan" |
| **Property Sum** | Sum of user profile property | "Total lifetime value" |
| **Property Average** | Average of user profile property | "Average wallet age" |

### Transaction-Based Measurements

| Measurement | Description | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| **Unique Wallets** | Count of distinct wallet addresses | "Unique wallets transacting" |
| **Total Transactions** | Count of all transactions | "Total swaps on-chain" |
| **Transaction Value Sum** | Sum of transaction values | "Total ETH swapped" |
| **Gas Sum** | Total gas spent | "Gas used by users" |

## Filters

Filter your data to focus on specific segments:

### Event Filters

```
Events where:
├── event_name = "swap_completed"
├── AND chain = "ethereum"
├── AND amount_usd > 100
└── AND timestamp in last 30 days
```

### User Property Filters

```
Users where:
├── plan = "pro"
├── AND country = "US"
└── AND is_web3_user = true
```

### Transaction Filters

```
Transactions where:
├── contract_name = "Swap Router"
├── AND method_name = "swapExactTokensForTokens"
└── AND status = "confirmed"
```

See [Filters & Operators](/analysis/filters-and-operators) for the complete operator reference.

## Breakdowns

Breakdowns segment your metric by a property value:

### Single Breakdown

```
Total Swaps broken down by Chain:
├── ethereum: 1,234
├── polygon: 892
├── arbitrum: 567
└── base: 445
```

### Multiple Breakdowns

```
Total Swaps by Chain and Token:
├── ethereum
│   ├── ETH: 800
│   ├── USDC: 300
│   └── DAI: 134
├── polygon
│   ├── MATIC: 500
│   └── USDC: 392
└── ...
```

### Breakdown Properties

You can break down by:
- **Event properties**: `chain`, `input_token`, `wallet_type`
- **User properties**: `country`, `plan`, `device_type`
- **Transaction properties**: `method_name`, `contract_name`
- **Time**: Day, week, month

## Visualizations

Cryptique offers 9 chart types to visualize your data:

### Time-Series Charts

For viewing metrics over time:

| Chart | Best For |
|-------|----------|
| **Line** | Trends over time, comparing multiple metrics |
| **Stacked Line** | Composition trends, showing parts of a whole over time |
| **Column** | Discrete time periods, comparing specific days/weeks |
| **Stacked Column** | Composition by time period, part-to-whole by day/week |

### Comparison Charts

For viewing totals and comparisons:

| Chart | Best For |
|-------|----------|
| **Bar** | Horizontal comparisons, ranking categories |
| **Stacked Bar** | Composition within horizontal categories |
| **Pie** | Part-to-whole relationships, distribution |
| **Cards** | Single headline metrics, KPIs at a glance |
| **Table** | Detailed data, multiple dimensions, drill-down |

## Advanced Features

### Multiple Metrics

Compare multiple metrics in one report:

```
Metric A: Unique users who viewed pool
Metric B: Unique users who added liquidity
Metric C: Unique users who transacted on-chain

→ See conversion through the journey
```

### Formulas

Create calculated metrics:

```
Formula: (Metric B / Metric A) * 100

Where:
- Metric A = Users who connected wallet
- Metric B = Users who transacted

Result: Wallet-to-transaction conversion rate
```

### Time Comparisons

Compare current period to previous:

```
This Week vs Last Week:
├── Swaps: 1,234 (+15%)
├── Unique Users: 567 (+8%)
└── Volume: $1.2M (-3%)
```

### Cohort Comparison

Compare metrics across cohorts:

```
Swap frequency by user type:
├── Whales (>$10k volume): 12.5 swaps/week
├── Active ($1k-$10k): 4.2 swaps/week
└── Casual (<$1k): 1.1 swaps/week
```

## Table Features

When using table visualization:

### Sorting

Click column headers to sort:
- **A-Z**: Alphabetical ascending
- **Z-A**: Alphabetical descending
- **Value ↑**: Lowest to highest
- **Value ↓**: Highest to lowest

### Dynamic Segments

Control how many segments to display:
- Show top 5, 10, 20, or all
- Automatically updates as data changes

### Totals & Subtotals

- **Overall**: Total across all segments
- **Sub-totals**: Totals within each breakdown group

## Web3-Specific Examples

### Transaction Volume by Chain

```
Event: Transaction
Measurement: Sum of value (ETH)
Breakdown: chain
Visualization: Bar chart

Result:
├── ethereum: 1,234 ETH
├── arbitrum: 892 ETH
├── polygon: 567 ETH
└── base: 445 ETH
```

### Wallet Connection Trend

```
Event: wallet_connect
Measurement: Unique users
Time: Last 30 days, daily
Visualization: Line chart

Result: See daily wallet connections trend
```

### Top Tokens by Swap Count

```
Event: swap_completed
Measurement: Total count
Breakdown: output_token
Filter: chain = "ethereum"
Visualization: Horizontal bar

Result: Ranked list of tokens by swap popularity
```

### Cross-Chain User Analysis

```
Event: Transaction
Measurement: Unique wallets
Breakdown: chain
Filter: Users where session_count > 5

Result: Active users per chain
```

## Best Practices

### Start Simple

Begin with one metric and basic filters, then add complexity:

```
1. Total swaps (simple count)
2. + Filter by chain = "ethereum"
3. + Breakdown by token
4. + Compare to last period
```

### Use Meaningful Comparisons

Compare like with like:

```
✅ Good: Compare swap_completed across chains
✅ Good: Compare wallet_connect by utm_source

❌ Misleading: Compare daily vs weekly metrics
❌ Misleading: Compare different time periods without normalizing
```

### Name Your Reports

Save reports with clear names:

```
✅ "Weekly Swap Volume by Chain"
✅ "Twitter Campaign - Wallet Connections"
✅ "Power User Transaction Frequency"

❌ "Report 1"
❌ "Test"
```

## Saving & Sharing

### Save Report

1. Click **Save** after building your report
2. Enter a descriptive name
3. Choose visibility:
   - **Personal**: Only you can see
   - **Team**: All team members can see

### Add to Board

1. Click **Add to Board**

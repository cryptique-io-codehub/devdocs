## Overview

Retention analysis measures how well you keep users engaged over time. Track whether users return after their first visit, first transaction, or any milestone event—and understand what drives long-term engagement.

## Use Cases

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Product Health">
    - What percentage of new users return after 7 days?

    - How does retention compare across user segments?
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Web3 Engagement">
    - Do users continue transacting after their first swap?
    - What's the retention curve for NFT collectors?
    - Are users on different chains retained differently?
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Feature Impact">

## Quick Start

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define Birth Event">
    The event that "births" users into the cohort:
    
    ```
    Birth Event: signup_completed
    (or: wallet_connect, first_transaction, etc.)
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Define Return Event">
    The event that indicates a user "returned":
    
    ```
    Return Event: any_active_event
    (or: transaction, swap_completed, page_view, etc.)
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Choose Time Frame">
    Set the cohort interval and retention window:
    
    ```
    Cohort Interval: Weekly (users grouped by week they were born)
    Retention Window: 8 weeks
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Criteria">
    Choose when users count as retained:
    - **On or After**: Any time from that day/week onward
    - **On**: Only on exactly that day/week
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Retention Criteria

### On or After (Default)

User counts as retained if they returned **on or after** the specified time period:

```
Day 7 retention (On or After):
User returned on Day 7, 8, 9, 10... → Retained ✓
User returned on Day 1-6 only → NOT Retained ✗
```

Best for: Understanding cumulative engagement over time.

### On

User counts as retained only if they returned **exactly on** that period:

```
Day 7 retention (On):
User returned exactly on Day 7 → Retained ✓
User returned on Day 6 or Day 8 → NOT Retained ✗
```

Best for: Understanding precise return patterns.

## Cohort Intervals

Group users by when they were "born":

### Daily Cohorts

```
Daily cohorts over 14 days:
├── Jan 1 cohort: Users born on Jan 1
├── Jan 2 cohort: Users born on Jan 2
├── ...
└── Jan 14 cohort: Users born on Jan 14

See: Day 1, Day 2, ... Day 14 retention for each
```

Best for: Short-term retention analysis, fast-moving products.

### Weekly Cohorts

```
Weekly cohorts over 8 weeks:
├── Week 1 cohort: Users born Jan 1-7
├── Week 2 cohort: Users born Jan 8-14
├── ...
└── Week 8 cohort: Users born Feb 19-25

See: Week 1, Week 2, ... Week 8 retention for each
```

Best for: Most retention analyses, standard timeframe.

### Monthly Cohorts

```
Monthly cohorts over 6 months:
├── January cohort: Users born in January
├── February cohort: Users born in February
├── ...
└── June cohort: Users born in June

See: Month 1, Month 2, ... Month 6 retention for each
```

Best for: Long-term retention, subscription products.

## Custom Brackets

Define custom retention windows:

```
Custom brackets: [1, 3, 7, 14, 30, 60, 90]

View retention at:
├── Day 1
├── Day 3
├── Day 7
├── Day 14
├── Day 30
├── Day 60
└── Day 90
```

## Reading the Retention Table

```
           │ Day 0 │ Day 1 │ Day 7 │ Day 14 │ Day 30
───────────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼────────┼────────
Jan 1-7    │ 1,000 │  42%  │  28%  │   22%  │   15%
Jan 8-14   │   850 │  45%  │  30%  │   24%  │   18%
Jan 15-21  │ 1,200 │  38%  │  25%  │   20%  │    -
Jan 22-28  │   950 │  40%  │  27%  │    -   │    -
───────────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼────────┼────────
Average    │ 1,000 │  41%  │  28%  │   22%  │   17%
```

**Column meanings:**
- **Day 0**: Number of users in cohort (birth event count)
- **Day N**: Percentage who returned on/after day N

**Row meanings:**
- Each row is a cohort (users born in that period)
- Newer cohorts have fewer data points (diagonal empty)

## Retention Curves

### Visualizing Retention

```
100% ─┬────────────────────────
      │\
      │ \
  50% ─┤  \___
      │      \_____
      │            \________
   0% ─┴─────────────────────────
      Day 0  7  14  21  28  35
```

**Healthy retention**: Curve flattens (users who stay, stay)
**Concerning retention**: Curve keeps declining (ongoing churn)

### Comparing Curves

## Filters

Focus on specific user segments:

### Birth Event Filters

Filter who enters the cohort:

```
Birth Event: signup_completed
  └── where: signup_source = "twitter"

Only users who signed up from Twitter
```

### Return Event Filters

Filter what counts as "returning":

```
Return Event: transaction
  └── where: chain = "ethereum"

Users must transact on Ethereum to count as retained
```

### User Property Filters

Filter by user attributes:

```
User Filter:
├── plan = "pro"
├── AND country = "US"

Retention for US Pro users only
```

## Breakdowns

Compare retention across segments:

### By User Property

```
Retention by plan:
├── Pro: 45% → 32% → 28%
├── Free: 38% → 22% → 15%
└── Trial: 25% → 12% → 8%
```

### By Birth Event Property

```
Retention by signup_source:
├── Twitter: 40% → 28% → 22%
├── Discord: 52% → 38% → 32%
└── Google: 35% → 20% → 14%
```

### By Cohort Date

Default view—compare how retention changes over time:

```
Are newer cohorts retaining better?
├── Jan cohorts: 40% → 25% → 18%
├── Feb cohorts: 42% → 28% → 22%
└── Mar cohorts: 45% → 32% → 25%

→ Yes! Retention is improving
```

## Web3 Retention Examples

### Transaction Retention

Track on-chain engagement:

```
Birth Event: First transaction
Return Event: Any transaction

Question: Do users keep transacting?
```

### Protocol Stickiness

```
Birth Event: First swap
Return Event: swap_completed
Filter by: chain = "arbitrum"

Question: Do Arbitrum users keep swapping?
```

### NFT Collector Retention

```
Birth Event: First NFT mint
Return Event: Any NFT activity (mint, transfer, sale)

Question: Do minters become collectors?
```

### Feature-Driven Retention

```
Birth Event: used_advanced_feature
Return Event: any_active_event

Compare to:
Birth Event: did_not_use_advanced_feature
Return Event: any_active_event

Question: Does the feature improve retention?
```

## Analyzing Retention

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Description | Good Benchmark |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Day 1** | Next-day return | >40% |
| **Day 7** | Week 1 return | >25% |
| **Day 30** | Month 1 return | >15% |
| **Plateau** | Stable long-term retention | >10% |

### Signs of Healthy Retention

```
✅ Curve flattens (stabilizes)
✅ Newer cohorts retain better
✅ Power users have much higher retention
✅ Key features correlate with retention
```

### Warning Signs

```
❌ Curve never flattens (constant churn)
❌ Newer cohorts performing worse
❌ No difference between segments
❌ Day 1 retention below 30%
```

## Best Practices

### Choose Meaningful Events

```
✅ Good birth events:
- signup_completed (clear milestone)
- wallet_connect (clear commitment)
- first_transaction (value delivered)

❌ Poor birth events:
- page_view (too broad)
- click (too minor)
```

### Match Return to Product

```
Social app: Return = any_active_event
DeFi protocol: Return = transaction
Marketplace: Return = purchase OR listing
SaaS: Return = feature_used
```

### Segment Meaningfully

Compare segments that inform action:

```
✅ Actionable:
- By signup_source (optimize marketing)
- By completed_onboarding (improve onboarding)
- By user_tier (price/feature adjustments)

❌ Not actionable:
- By random_id
- By timestamp
```

### Allow Enough Time

Retention analysis needs mature data:

```
For Day 30 retention with weekly cohorts:
Need 5-6 weeks of data minimum

For quarterly analysis:
Need 6+ months of data
```

## Overview

Flows (also called Sankey diagrams) visualize the paths users take through your product. See what users do before and after any event, discover common patterns, and identify unexpected behaviors.

## Use Cases

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="User Journey Discovery">
    - What do users do after connecting their wallet?
    - What actions lead to a first transaction?
    - Where do users go after viewing the pricing page?
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Drop-off Analysis">
    - Where do users go instead of converting?
    - What do users do after abandoning checkout?
    - Why are users leaving the swap page?
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Feature Discovery">
    - How do users discover feature X?
    - What's the typical path to becoming a power user?
    - Do users explore multiple chains before settling?
  </Accordion>

## Flow Directions

### Steps After

See what users do **after** an event:

```
                    ┌─→ swap_completed (40%)
wallet_connect ─────┼─→ page_view: /pools (25%)
                    ├─→ page_view: /docs (20%)
                    └─→ session_end (15%)
```

**Use for:**
- Understanding what users do after key milestones
- Identifying next-step opportunities
- Finding unexpected behaviors

### Steps Before

See what users do **before** an event:

```
page_view: /landing (30%) ─┐
page_view: /docs (25%) ────┼─→ wallet_connect
referral_link (25%) ───────┤
direct_visit (20%) ────────┘
```

**Use for:**
- Understanding what leads to conversions
- Identifying effective entry points
- Discovering successful paths

### Steps Before & After

See the complete journey around an event:

```
[Before]                  [Event]              [After]
landing (30%) ──┐                      ┌──→ swap_init (40%)
docs (25%) ─────┼──→ wallet_connect ───┼──→ pool_view (25%)
referral (25%) ─┤                      ├──→ docs (20%)
direct (20%) ───┘                      └──→ leave (15%)
```

**Use for:**
- Complete journey understanding
- Before/after comparisons
- Holistic flow analysis

## Reading Flow Diagrams

### Sankey Structure

```
                         ┌──→ Event B (500 users, 50%)
Event A (1000 users) ────┤
                         ├──→ Event C (300 users, 30%)
                         │
                         └──→ Event D (200 users, 20%)
```

**Wider paths** = More users taking that route
**Percentages** = Share of users from previous step

### Multi-Step Flows

```
Step 1          Step 2            Step 3
                ┌──→ swap ────────┬──→ success (80%)
connect ────────┤                 └──→ fail (20%)
                │
                ├──→ pool ────────┬──→ add_liq (60%)
                │                 └──→ leave (40%)
                │
                └──→ leave ───────── (end)
```

## Configuration Options

### Number of Steps

Control how many steps to display:

```
1 step: Immediate next action only
3 steps: Short journey
5 steps: Medium journey (recommended)
10 steps: Full exploration
```

### Hide Events

Remove noise by hiding irrelevant events:

```
Hide events:
- page_view (too noisy)
- scroll (not meaningful)
- mouse_move (irrelevant)

Keep:
- wallet_connect
- swap_completed
- transaction
```

### Breakdown by Property

Split flows by a property:

```
Breakdown: device_type

Mobile:
connect → swap (25%) → success

Desktop:
connect → swap (45%) → success

→ Desktop users convert better!
```

## Filters

Focus on specific user segments or behaviors:

### Event Filters

Filter the starting event:

```
Starting Event: wallet_connect
  └── where: wallet_type = "metamask"

Only MetaMask connections
```

### User Filters

Filter by user properties:

```
User Filter:
├── country = "US"
├── AND plan = "pro"

US Pro users only
```

### Time Filters

Analyze specific periods:

```
Time Range: Last 30 days
Granularity: Daily

See recent behavior patterns
```

## Web3 Flow Examples

### Post-Wallet Connection

```
Starting Event: wallet_connect
Direction: 5 Steps After

What do users do after connecting?
├── 40% → swap_initiated
│         └── 75% → transaction (swap)
├── 25% → pool_viewed
│         └── 50% → liquidity_added
├── 20% → docs_viewed
│         └── 30% → wallet_connect (different wallet?)
└── 15% → session_end
          └── (left without action)
```

### Pre-Transaction Path

```
Starting Event: Transaction (any)
Direction: 5 Steps Before

What leads to on-chain transactions?
├── swap_initiated (60%)
│   └── swap_quoted (85%)
│       └── token_selected (90%)
├── liquidity_add_clicked (20%)
│   └── pool_viewed (75%)
└── stake_clicked (20%)
    └── staking_page_viewed (80%)
```

### Cross-Chain Exploration

```
Starting Event: chain_changed
Direction: Steps Before & After
Breakdown: new_chain

Before changing to Arbitrum:
├── swap_failed (gas error) on Ethereum (40%)
├── price_comparison_viewed (35%)
└── gas_estimate_viewed (25%)

After changing to Arbitrum:
├── swap_completed (65%)
└── returned_to_ethereum (35%)
```

### NFT Journey

```
Starting Event: nft_viewed
Direction: 5 Steps After
Filter: collection = "CoolCats"

├── 35% → additional_nft_viewed
├── 30% → wallet_connect
│         └── 60% → mint_initiated
│                   └── 70% → transaction (mint)
├── 20% → collection_explored
└── 15% → session_end
```

## Analyzing Flows

### Identifying Patterns

**High-Volume Paths:**
Look for the thickest flows—these are your main user journeys.

```
If 60% of users go: landing → docs → wallet_connect
→ Optimize this path! It's your main funnel.
```

**Unexpected Paths:**
Look for surprising flows.

```
If 20% of users go: checkout → settings → checkout
→ Are they looking for payment options?
```

### Identifying Drop-Off

**Exit Points:**
Where do users leave?

```
swap_initiated → session_end (25%)
→ Users leaving before completing—investigate UX
```

**Detours:**
Where do users go instead of converting?

```
Expected: swap_page → swap_completed
Actual: swap_page → docs (40%)
→ Users need more information before swapping
```

### Comparing Segments

Use breakdowns to compare:

```
Mobile vs Desktop after wallet_connect:

Mobile:
├── swap: 25%
├── leave: 40%
└── browse: 35%

Desktop:
├── swap: 45%
├── leave: 20%
└── browse: 35%

→ Mobile users leaving more—mobile UX issue?
```

## Best Practices

### Choose Meaningful Starting Events

```
✅ Good starting events:
- wallet_connect (key milestone)
- purchase_completed (conversion point)
- feature_used (engagement signal)
- signup_completed (lifecycle event)

❌ Poor starting events:
- page_view (too broad)
- click (too generic)
- scroll (not meaningful)
```

### Hide Noise

Remove events that obscure patterns:

```
Hide:
- Generic page_views (keep specific ones)
- Scroll events
- Mouse events
- Internal/system events
```

### Use Appropriate Step Counts

```
Immediate impact: 1-2 steps
Journey analysis: 3-5 steps
Full exploration: 5-10 steps

More steps = more complexity
Start small, expand as needed
```

### Segment Meaningfully

```
✅ Actionable breakdowns:
- device_type (fix mobile?)
- traffic_source (optimize channel?)
- user_tier (different needs?)

❌ Not actionable:
- random_id
- timestamp
```

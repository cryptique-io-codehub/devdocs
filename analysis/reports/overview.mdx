## Common Features

All reports share these capabilities:

### Filtering

Narrow your analysis to specific users or events:

```
Show me:
- Users from United States
- Who are on the "pro" plan
- And connected a wallet in the last 30 days
```

### Breakdowns

Segment your data by properties:

```
Break down by:
- Country → See metrics per country
- Device type → Compare mobile vs desktop
- Wallet type → MetaMask vs WalletConnect
```

### Time Controls

Analyze any time period:

- **Date range**: Last 7 days, last 30 days, custom range
- **Granularity**: Hourly, daily, weekly, monthly
- **Comparison**: Compare to previous period

### Cross-Data Analysis

Combine off-chain and on-chain data:

```
Funnel:
1. page_view (website)
2. wallet_connect (website)  
3. swap_initiated (website)
4. swapExactTokensForTokens (blockchain transaction)
```

## Choosing the Right Report

| Question Type | Report | Example |
|--------------|--------|---------|
| "How many?" / "How much?" | Insights | Total swaps this month |
| "What percentage convert?" | Funnels | Conversion rate to first transaction |
| "Do users come back?" | Retention | 7-day retention after signup |
| "What path do users take?" | Flows | Actions after wallet connection |

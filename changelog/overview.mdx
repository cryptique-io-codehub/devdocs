## February 2026

### Week of Feb 1–7

<Update label="Configurable transaction columns" icon="table-columns">

- Column set: Smart contract (chain), Function name, Transaction time, Tx hash, Block, From, To, Value.
- Required columns (contract, function, time) always on; rest toggleable and reorderable.
- Column config modal: checkboxes and drag-and-drop; selection persisted with table preferences.
- Categories (e.g. core, blockchain, addresses) for easier grouping in the modal.

</Update>

### Week of Feb 8–14

<Update label="Transaction row & detail" icon="file-lines">

- Dedicated transaction row component: consistent formatting, truncation for long hashes/addresses, copy-to-clipboard.
- Transaction detail view: full hash, block, from/to, value, input data snippet, status, gas (when available).
- Properties tab: all known fields (contract, function, args, chain, timestamp) in a structured layout.
- Link to block explorer (chain-specific) when chain and hash are known.

</Update>

### Week of Feb 15–21

<Update label="Transactions filter module" icon="filter">

- Filter bar for transactions: by contract (multi-select), time range, optional wallet or hash search.
- Filter state synced with URL or local state so "filtered view" is shareable or restorable.
- Combined with events and sessions filters so "events in range → sessions → transactions" flows feel consistent.
- Clear filters and "no results" state with suggestion to widen criteria.

</Update>

### Week of Feb 22–28

<Update label="Sessions page & tables" icon="table-cells">

- Sessions page: list of sessions with duration, page views, first/last event, device, country.
- Session row: expand or click-through to session detail (timeline of pages and events).
- Alignment with events and transactions: same table styling, loading states, and empty states.
- Optional session-level filters (e.g. min duration, has event key) for funnel analysis.

</Update>

<Update label="On-chain table integration" icon="link">

- On-chain transactions table uses the same column config and filter module as the main Activity view.
- Transaction detail modal available from both Activity and any embedded transaction list.
- Team and contract scoping: only transactions for the team's registered contracts appear; no cross-team leakage.

</Update>

<Update label="Polish & performance" icon="sparkles">

- Shared data table styles: borders, density, hover, and focus for accessibility.
- Skeleton loaders and incremental load for large event/session/transaction lists.
- Error boundaries and inline error messages so one failed section doesn't break the whole page.
- Backend: transaction list API supports filter params and returns contract name and chain; response shape stable for the new UI.

</Update>

---

## January 2026

### Week of Jan 1–7

<Update label="User journey filter semantics" icon="filter">

- Filters (date, device, country, Web3 status, wallet net worth, etc.) apply only to the user list and to aggregate metrics.
- User detail, timeline, dapps, and tokens APIs ignore filters and return full history for the selected user.
- Documented contract: "filter to find users; then inspect anyone in full."
- Metrics (unique users, geography, devices, activity charts) respect current filter set.

</Update>

### Week of Jan 8–14

<Update label="Soneium wallet net worth" icon="coins">

- Dedicated pipeline: Blockscout API for Soneium balance and token list; DexScreener for USD prices.
- Native SONE + ERC-20 token balances; aggregated USD per wallet and stored in wallet_networth.soneium.
- Rate limiting and retries (exponential backoff + jitter); timeouts to avoid hanging.
- On failure: return 0 or last-known value; never fail the whole aggregation.

</Update>

<Update label="Chain config expansion" icon="link">

- Central chain config: chain ID, name, API provider (Etherscan-compatible, Blockscout, etc.), transaction caps, block chunk size, and API offset limits.
- Dozens of networks supported (Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, Polygon, Optimism, BNB, Avalanche, Soneium, Berachain, etc.).
- Per-chain transaction fetcher tuning so we stay within provider limits and avoid bans.

</Update>

### Week of Jan 15–21

<Update label="Conversion events experience" icon="bolt">

- Dedicated Events view: list of events with key, count, last seen; filters by key, time, property.
- Sessions view: session list with duration, page views, device, location; link to event list for that session.
- Activity view: on-chain transactions for the team's contracts; table with hash, block, from/to, value, time, function.
- Shared filter bar and filter modules (dropdowns, date range, multi-select) across events/sessions/activity.
- Event detail: payload, related sessions/users; session detail: pages, events, and linked identity.

</Update>

### Week of Jan 22–31

<Update label="Preferences & persistence" icon="floppy-disk">

- User preferences API and client state for table column visibility and order.
- Preferences keyed by team and optional user; defaults for new users.
- Conversion events tables (events, sessions, transactions) respect saved column sets.
- Last-used time range and filters considered for "restore previous session" (where implemented).

</Update>

<Update label="Transaction table behavior" icon="table-list">

- Transaction list: sort by time, filter by contract, time range, wallet (future).
- Display of contract name + chain; function name from decoded input where ABI is present.
- Value formatting (wei → human-readable; optional USD if price pipeline exists).
- Pagination and "load more" with stable ordering (transaction_time, id).

</Update>

<Update label="Identify & distinct ID" icon="fingerprint">

- Identify API: attach email, name, phone, and custom traits to user_id; stored on user_identities.
- distinct_id: optional stable cross-device ID; added to user_identities, sessions, events, and UTM event logs.
- Merge logic: same user_id with different distinct_id can be linked for analytics.

<Update label="Transaction ingestion" icon="arrow-down">

- Transaction fetcher worker: block-range polling with configurable chunk size (e.g. 100k blocks).
- Per-chain API limits and backoff (e.g. Etherscan 10k results per request); rate limiting and jitter.
- Stored fields: tx hash, block number, from/to, value, timestamp, contract_id, team_id.
- Incremental append; duplicate hashes ignored for idempotency.

</Update>

### Week of Oct 8–14

<Update label="User identity model" icon="user">

- Unified identity: one row per (user_id, team_id, website_id) with composite unique constraint.
- First/last visit, total page views, total time spent; first/last country and city.
- Device type, browser, OS from user-agent parsing (mobile/tablet/desktop).
- Optional Web3 fields: primary_wallet_address, other_wallets, wallet_type, chain.

</Update>

<Update label="Session–identity sync" icon="link">

- Every session create/update triggers identity upsert: new identity or merge into existing.
- Session IDs array on identity for “all sessions for this user”; no duplicate sessions.
- Migration of legacy session data into user_identities with preserved timestamps.

</Update>

### Week of Oct 15–21

<Update label="Transaction–identity linkage" icon="wallet">

- Rule: link transaction to identity only if wallet matches identity’s primary or other_wallets (canonical lowercase).
- Contract must belong to the same team; team_id enforced on both transactions and identities.
- contract_transaction_ids array on identity; aligned to_value and from_value arrays (same length).
- Direction: to_address match → append to to_value; from_address match → append to from_value.
- Internal transfers (same user to self): two entries appended (in and out) for correct totals.

</Update>

<Update label="Value aggregation" icon="calculator">

- to_value/from_value as JSONB arrays; GIN indexes for “has transaction in range” queries.
- Full recompute: by team contracts → identities with wallets → transactions → match and overwrite arrays.
- Incremental: on transaction batch insert, fetch new txs, resolve contract and identities, append only.
- Array length invariant: len(contract_transaction_ids) == len(to_value) == len(from_value) enforced on write.

</Update>

### Week of Oct 22–31

<Update label="Wallet net worth format" icon="coins">

- wallet_networth schema: per-chain or per-asset breakdown; migration from legacy single-value format.
- Backward-compatible reads during migration; old clients still receive a valid structure.

</Update>

<Update label="Custom dashboards" icon="table-cells">

- Dashboard entity: name, layout (grid), saved query references, and visibility (private/team).
- Row-level security so users only see dashboards they own or are shared with.
- Query execution with parameter binding and timeout; results cached for repeat views.

</Update>

<Update label="Device extraction" icon="mobile">

- User-agent → device_type (mobile/tablet/desktop) with fallback to “unknown”.

</Update>

### Week of Nov 8–14

<Update label="Events table & primary keys" icon="key">

- New events schema with integer primary keys; raw_event_logs stores integer session_ids and user_ids.
- Ingestion: client sends external UUIDs; backend resolves to internal PKs and stores PKs only.
- Resolution strict: missing session or user → 4xx and event not stored.
- Event definition details API: joins back to sessions/user_identities to return external UUIDs in responses so client contract unchanged.

</Update>

### Week of Nov 15–21

<Update label="User journey & events" icon="route">

- User timeline API: events filtered by external user_id via join on user_identities (internal PK in raw_event_logs).

- Deprecation of old custom-events tables; one events pipeline and one schema.

</Update>

<Update label="Credits & ledger" icon="book">

- Team usage ledger: debits for events, API calls, etc.; credits for plan allowances or top-ups.
- Credit operations table for audit trail (grant, consume, expire).
- Billing logic migrated to ledger + operations; subscription downgrade applies to future periods only.

</Update>

### Week of Nov 22–30

<Update label="Data architecture" icon="database">

- PostgreSQL 16 + TimescaleDB: hypertables for time-series (sessions, events); standard tables for relational data.
- JSONB for flexible event payloads and wallet_networth; GIN where needed.
- Documented scalability path: single DB → read replicas → optional event streaming.
- Backup and retention policy documented; point-in-time recovery options.

</Update>

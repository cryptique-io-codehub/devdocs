## Overview

Cryptique tracks data from two sources: websites (sites) and blockchain smart contracts. This guide covers how to configure and manage both.

## Sites

Sites are the websites or web applications you want to track with Cryptique.

### Adding a Site

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Settings">
    Navigate to **Settings** → **Sites**
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add New Site">
    Click **Add Site**
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Site">
    - **Name**: Human-readable name (e.g., "Production App")
    - **Domain**: Your website domain (e.g., `app.example.com`)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Get Site ID">
    After creation, you'll receive a **Site ID** to use in your tracking code
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Site Configuration

```
Site: Production App
├── Site ID: prod-app-12345
├── Domain: app.example.com
├── Status: Active
├── Created: Jan 1, 2024
└── Last Event: 2 minutes ago
```

### Multiple Sites

One team can have multiple sites:

```
Team Sites:
├── Production (app.example.com)
│   └── Site ID: prod-app-12345
├── Staging (staging.example.com)
│   └── Site ID: staging-app-67890
└── Marketing (www.example.com)
    └── Site ID: marketing-site-abcde
```

**Use cases for multiple sites:**
- Separate production and staging
- Track multiple products
- Different domains for different regions

### Domain Whitelist

For security, Cryptique only accepts events from whitelisted domains:

```
Allowed Domains for prod-app-12345:
├── app.example.com ✓
├── www.example.com ✓
└── *.example.com (wildcard) ✓
```

Add domains that should be allowed to send events with this Site ID.

### Site Settings

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Auto-enhance** | Enable/disable wallet enrichment |
| **Auto-events** | Default auto-event configuration |
| **Allowed domains** | Domains that can send events |
| **Data retention** | How long to keep event data |

## Smart Contracts

Smart contracts let you track on-chain transactions and link them to user behavior.

### Adding a Contract

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Contracts">
    Navigate to **Settings** → **Contracts**
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Contract">
    Click **Add Contract**
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enter Details">
    - **Name**: Human-readable name (e.g., "Swap Router")
    - **Address**: Contract address (e.g., `0x1234...abcd`)
    - **Chain**: Select blockchain network
    - **ABI** (optional): Contract ABI for method decoding
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save">
    Contract transactions will start appearing in your data
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Contract Configuration

```
Contract: Swap Router
├── Address: 0x1234567890abcdef...
├── Chain: Ethereum
├── Status: Active
├── ABI: Uploaded ✓
├── Methods Tracked: swapExactTokensForTokens, swapTokensForExactTokens
└── Last Transaction: 5 minutes ago
```

### Supported Chains

Cryptique supports 35 chains for smart contract tracking:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="EVM Chains">
    - Ethereum
    - Polygon
    - Arbitrum
    - Optimism
    - Base
    - Avalanche
    - BNB Chain
    - Fantom
    - Gnosis
    - And more...
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Layer 2s">
    - Arbitrum One
    - Arbitrum Nova
    - Optimism
    - Base
    - zkSync Era
    - Polygon zkEVM
    - Linea
    - Scroll
    - And more...
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

See [Chain Support](/integrations/overview) for the complete list.

### Contract Naming

Use consistent names across contracts for cross-protocol analysis:

```
✅ Good naming:
├── "Swap Router" (on Ethereum)
├── "Swap Router" (on Polygon)
├── "Swap Router" (on Arbitrum)
└── All appear as "Swap Router" in reports

❌ Poor naming:
├── "Uniswap V3 Router ETH"
├── "Polygon Swap"
├── "Arb Router Contract"
└── Appears as separate entities
```

Consistent naming lets you:
- Filter by contract name across all chains
- Compare performance across chains
- Create unified reports

### ABI Upload

Upload the contract ABI to decode method names and parameters:

**Without ABI:**
```
Transaction:
├── Method: 0x38ed1739
├── Input: 0x00000...
└── (Raw data only)
```

**With ABI:**
```
Transaction:
├── Method: swapExactTokensForTokens
├── Parameters:
│   ├── amountIn: 1000000000000000000
│   ├── amountOutMin: 950000000
│   ├── path: [0xETH..., 0xUSDC...]
│   └── deadline: 1707994800
└── (Human-readable)
```

### Multi-Chain Contracts

For contracts deployed on multiple chains, add each deployment:

```
Swap Router (Multi-chain):
├── Ethereum: 0x1234...
├── Polygon: 0x5678...
├── Arbitrum: 0x9abc...
└── Base: 0xdef0...
```

Use the same **Name** for all deployments to enable cross-chain analysis.

## Data Flow

### Site → Contract Attribution

When a user:
1. Visits your site (tracked via Site ID)
2. Connects their wallet (captured via SDK)
3. Makes a transaction (tracked via Contract)

Cryptique links all three via the wallet address, creating complete attribution.

```
User Journey:
├── [Site] page_view (landing)
├── [Site] wallet_connect (0x1234...)
├── [Site] swap_initiated
└── [Contract] swapExactTokensForTokens (0x1234...)

→ Full attribution: Landing → Wallet → Transaction
```

### Cross-Site Tracking

If a user visits multiple sites with the same wallet:

```
User: 0x1234...
├── Site A: 15 events
├── Site B: 8 events
└── Contract: 5 transactions

→ Unified user profile across sites
```

## Managing Sites & Contracts

### Edit Configuration

1. Go to **Settings** → **Sites** or **Contracts**
2. Click the item to edit
3. Modify settings
4. Save changes

### Archive vs Delete

**Archive**: Stops tracking new data but preserves historical data
**Delete**: Removes configuration (historical data retained per retention policy)

<Warning>
Deleting a site removes the Site ID. Any tracking code using that ID will stop working.
</Warning>

### Status Monitoring

Check health of your sites and contracts:

```
Sites Status:
├── prod-app-12345: ✅ Active (1,234 events/hour)
├── staging-67890: ⚠️ Low activity (2 events/hour)
└── old-site-xyz: ❌ No events (30+ days)

Contracts Status:
├── Swap Router (ETH): ✅ Active (45 txns/hour)
├── Swap Router (POLY): ✅ Active (120 txns/hour)
└── Old Contract: ❌ No transactions (60+ days)
```

## Best Practices

### Site Organization

```
✅ Recommended:
├── One site per environment (prod, staging, dev)
├── Separate sites for distinct products
├── Consistent naming convention

❌ Avoid:
├── One site for everything (hard to filter)
├── Duplicate sites for same domain
├── Cryptic Site IDs in production code
```

### Contract Organization

```
✅ Recommended:
├── Consistent names across chains
├── Upload ABIs for better data
├── Group related contracts logically
├── Archive unused contracts

❌ Avoid:
├── Different names for same contract on different chains
├── Tracking contracts you don't own (unless needed)
├── Leaving stale contracts active
```

### Security

- Keep Site IDs confidential (treat like API keys)
- Use domain whitelisting
- Regularly audit active sites and contracts
- Remove unused configurations

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Events not appearing for site">
    1. Verify Site ID in tracking code
    2. Check domain is whitelisted
    3. Ensure SDK is loading correctly
    4. Check browser console for errors
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Contract transactions not tracked">
    1. Verify contract address is correct
    2. Check chain selection
    3. Ensure contract is active on-chain
    4. Wait a few minutes for indexing
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Method names showing as hex">
    Upload the contract ABI to decode method names and parameters.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Cross-chain data not linking">
    Ensure contracts use the same **Name** across all chains for unified reporting.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

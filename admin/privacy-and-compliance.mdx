## Overview

Cryptique is designed with privacy in mind. This guide covers data handling practices, compliance features, and how to configure privacy settings for your team.

## Data Collection

### What Cryptique Collects

**Automatically collected:**
- Page views and navigation
- User interactions (clicks, scrolls, form submissions)
- Device and browser information
- Geographic location (approximate, from IP)
- Session data
- Wallet connections (when detected)
- On-chain transactions (for tracked contracts)

**Not collected:**
- Form field values (only metadata)
- Passwords or sensitive credentials
- Credit card numbers
- Personal health information
- Full IP addresses (not stored)

### Default Properties

All automatically captured properties are listed in [Default Properties](/data-in/default-properties).

```
What's captured:
├── country: "US" (approximate)
├── city: "San Francisco" (approximate)
├── device_type: "desktop"
├── browser_name: "Chrome"
└── ...

What's NOT captured:
├── IP address (used for geo, then discarded)
├── form_values (only form metadata)
└── sensitive_data
```

## Privacy by Design

### IP Address Handling

Cryptique uses IP addresses for geolocation but does not store them:

```
Request comes in with IP: 192.168.1.1
├── Geolocation lookup → "San Francisco, US"
├── IP discarded (not stored)
└── Event stored with location only
```

### Data Minimization

We collect only what's necessary:

- Element text is truncated (not full page content)
- Copied text is limited to 100 characters
- Form values are excluded (only form metadata)
- Input changes track field names, not values

### Pseudonymization

User identifiers are pseudonymous by default:

```
Anonymous user: anon_abc123xyz
Identified user: user_provided_id (your choice)
```

You control what identifying information to associate with users.

## Consent Management

### Consent-Based Tracking

Cryptique can be loaded conditionally based on user consent:

```javascript
// Only load after consent
if (userHasConsented()) {
  var script = document.createElement('script');
  script.src = 'https://cdn.cryptique.io/scripts/analytics/1.0.1/cryptique.script.min.js';
  script.setAttribute('site-id', 'YOUR_SITE_ID');
  document.head.appendChild(script);
}
```

### Integration with CMPs

Works with Consent Management Platforms:

**OneTrust:**
```javascript
OneTrust.OnConsentChanged(function(e) {
  if (OnetrustActiveGroups.includes('C0002')) {
    // Performance cookies consented - load Cryptique
    loadCryptique();
  }
});
```

**Cookiebot:**
```javascript
window.addEventListener('CookiebotOnAccept', function(e) {
  if (Cookiebot.consent.statistics) {
    loadCryptique();
  }
});
```

### Opt-Out Mechanism

Provide users a way to opt out:

```javascript
// User opts out
function optOutCryptique() {
  if (window.cryptique) {
    window.cryptique.optOut();
  }
  localStorage.setItem('cryptique_opt_out', 'true');
}

// Check on page load
if (localStorage.getItem('cryptique_opt_out') === 'true') {
  // Don't load Cryptique
} else {
  loadCryptique();
}
```

## Data Retention

### Retention Periods

Configure how long data is retained:

| Data Type | Default Retention | Configurable |
|-----------|------------------|--------------|
| Events | 12 months | Yes |
| User profiles | 12 months | Yes |
| Sessions | 12 months | Yes |
| Transactions | 12 months | Yes |

### Configuring Retention

1. Go to **Settings** → **Privacy**
2. Set retention period for each data type
3. Data older than retention period is automatically deleted

<Note>
Shorter retention periods reduce storage but limit historical analysis.
</Note>

## Data Access & Export

### Who Can Access Data

| Role | Data Access |
|------|-------------|
| Super User | Full access |
| Admin | Full access |
| User | Full access (configurable) |

All data access is logged in the audit trail.

### User Data Requests

For GDPR/CCPA data subject requests:

**Data Export:**
1. Search for user by email, wallet, or ID
2. View user profile
3. Export user data as JSON

**Data Deletion:**
1. Search for user
2. Click **Delete Profile**
3. Confirm deletion

<Warning>
User deletion is permanent and cannot be undone.
</Warning>

## Audit Logging

All significant actions are logged:

```
Audit Log:
├── Feb 15, 2:30 PM │ admin@example.com │ Viewed user profile: user_123
├── Feb 15, 2:15 PM │ admin@example.com │ Exported user data: user_456
├── Feb 15, 1:00 PM │ owner@example.com │ Changed retention period to 6 months
├── Feb 14, 4:45 PM │ admin@example.com │ Deleted user profile: user_789
└── ...
```

**Logged actions:**
- User profile views
- Data exports
- Configuration changes

## Overview

Cryptique uses a role-based access system to manage team permissions. This guide covers user roles, invitations, and team administration.

## User Roles

Cryptique has three user roles with different permission levels:

### Super User (Team Owner)

The Super User is the team owner with full administrative control:

| Permission | Access |
|------------|--------|
| Billing management | ✅ Full access |
| Team deletion | ✅ Can delete team |
| Admin capabilities | ✅ All admin permissions |
| Invite users | ✅ Yes |
| Manage integrations | ✅ Yes |
| View all data | ✅ Yes |

<Note>
The Super User role is fixed and cannot be transferred. The person who created the team is automatically the Super User.
</Note>

### Admin

Admins can manage team settings and users but cannot access billing:

| Permission | Access |
|------------|--------|
| Billing management | ❌ No access |
| Team deletion | ❌ Cannot delete |
| Invite users | ✅ Yes |
| Remove users | ✅ Yes (except Super User) |
| Manage integrations | ✅ Yes |
| Configure settings | ✅ Yes |
| View all data | ✅ Yes |
| Create/edit reports | ✅ Yes |

| Billing management | ❌ No access |
| Team deletion | ❌ Cannot delete |
| Invite users | ❌ No |
| Manage integrations | ❌ No |
| Configure settings | ❌ No |

## Role Comparison

## Inviting Team Members

### Send Invitation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Team Settings">
    Navigate to **Settings** → **Team**
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click Invite">
    Click **Invite Team Member**
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enter Details">
    - Email address
    - Select role (Admin or User)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Send Invitation">
    Click **Send Invite**
    
    The user receives an email with a link to join your team.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Invitation Status

Track pending invitations:

```
Team Members:
├── john@example.com (Admin) - Active
├── jane@example.com (User) - Active
├── bob@example.com (User) - Pending (sent 2 days ago)
└── alice@example.com (Admin) - Pending (sent 1 hour ago)
```

### Resend or Cancel

For pending invitations:
- **Resend**: Send another invitation email
- **Cancel**: Remove the pending invitation

## Managing Team Members

### Change User Role

Admins and Super Users can change roles:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Team**
2. Find the user
3. Click role dropdown
4. Select new role (Admin or User)

<Warning>
You cannot change the Super User's role or demote yourself if you're the only Admin.
</Warning>

### Remove Team Member

1. Go to **Settings** → **Team**
2. Find the user to remove
3. Click **Remove** (trash icon)
4. Confirm removal

**What happens when removed:**
- User loses access immediately
- Personal saved reports become inaccessible
- Shared reports remain for the team
- User can be re-invited later

### Transfer Ownership

Currently, the Super User role cannot be transferred. Contact support if you need to change team ownership.

## Team Structure

### One Team, Multiple Sites

A single team can manage multiple sites:

```
Team: Acme Corp
├── Sites:
│   ├── acme-dex.com
│   ├── acme-nft.io
│   └── staging.acme-dex.com
│
├── Contracts:
│   ├── Acme Swap Router (ethereum)
│   ├── Acme NFT Collection (ethereum)
│   └── Acme Staking (polygon)
│
└── Team Members:
    ├── owner@acme.com (Super User)
    ├── dev@acme.com (Admin)
    └── analyst@acme.com (User)
```

All team members have access to all sites and contracts within the team.

### Audit Logging

All team actions are logged:

```
Audit Log:
├── Feb 15, 2:30 PM │ owner@acme.com │ Invited dev@acme.com as Admin
├── Feb 15, 10:00 AM │ dev@acme.com │ Added site: staging.acme-dex.com
├── Feb 14, 4:45 PM │ owner@acme.com │ Changed analyst@acme.com role to User
└── Feb 14, 3:00 PM │ dev@acme.com │ Removed contract: Old Router
```

## Best Practices

### Role Assignment

```
✅ Recommended:
- 1 Super User (team owner, handles billing)
- 1-2 Admins (technical leads, manage settings)
- Remaining team as Users (analysts, marketers)

❌ Avoid:
- Everyone as Admin (security risk)
- No backup Admin (single point of failure)
```

### Access Management

- **Review regularly**: Audit team members quarterly
- **Remove promptly**: Remove access when people leave
- **Least privilege**: Give minimum necessary permissions
- **Document roles**: Keep track of who has what access

### Security

- Use strong passwords
- Enable 2FA when available
- Don't share accounts
- Use individual invitations (not shared links)
